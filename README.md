# missing_common_genes_for_disease_pairs

The script "missing_common_gene_XQ" is written based on my understanding of
1. paper "Prediction of missing common genes for disease pairs using network
 based module separation on incomplete human interactome" by Pakeeza Akram and Li Liao\

2. Author Pakeeza's code.
3. Paper "Uncovering Disease-Disease Relationships Through The Human Interactome"
by Joerg Menche, Amitabh Sharma, Maksim Kitsak, Susan Dina Ghiassian,
Marc Vidal, Joseph Loscalzo & Albert-Laszlo Barabasi\
